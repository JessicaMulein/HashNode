# Transgender Mental Health

I just experienced one of the more mortifying moments in my life, and so naturally, I am going to tell the world about it. Unfortunately it seems to be something that needs discussing for the better potential future experiences of my brothers, sisters and non-binary individuals.

It is never a good sign when you are the impetus for massive retraining and multiple apologies- especially when the apologies do little to relieve the damage done, which is going to take me some time to process.

First, the why- I’ve been on unpaid leave due to my health and a series of shennanigans there with my insurers which has contributed a lot to stress. However, most recently was Easter. Holidays are hard as our kids (b. 2004 & 2015) were kidnapped in 2018. The combination of factors was a bit much for me and although not strictly wanting to self-harm or anything, I knew I needed some pharmaceutical changes to help with my depression and anxiety.

A great many things went wrong during my two and a half days- one spent in an ER waiting for placement, and another in a well seeming mental health hospital. Most of those things are unfortunately fairly normal during this process, but it all combined for a terrible experience where I didn’t get most of my meds, including my lyrica and duloxetine for nerve pain or estrogen for the entire time. If you’ve never had hot-flashes, they really suck when you’re dealing with a really bad day already. I also never got my CPAP, a machine that ensures I continue breathing throughout the night. I didn’t get my clothes until I was leaving.

I should have listened to my gut. After I arrived at the second facility (waylaid by Biden’s visit to our fair state, netting me an hour and a half ambulance ride), I suddenly had an intense worry that I was not going to be accepted on the floor or perhaps by my roommate. The admit lady assured me that they’ve had many trans people of all sorts and that I would be fine. I have rarely been overcome by such worry and I very strongly felt that I couldn’t and shouldn’t proceed. I should have listened to my sixth sense. Meanwhile, an hour or so away, my wife and mother in law were tuned into the same channel and got a bad feeling about me.

Normally, you’d think my genitals weren’t much of anyone’s business- as I thought. I’ve had surgery, which is sort of “partial”. Can’t tell when I’m in underwear, but things are slightly differently configured.

Upon my arrival to the women’s floor, I underwent the usual “skin check” where they look over every inch of you. I wasn’t sure what the nurse knew, so I said “just so you know, I am trans…” and kind of left the rest to her own conclusions. She did not intend to be mean, she was just clarifying my status, but she made an inappropriate comment. We then proceeded to answer some questions, at which point she said my potential roommate could be startled/alarmed/concerned by my “situation” for lack of a better word. They then went ahead and told the whole floor I am trans and that that was the reason we had to shuffle rooms so I could be alone.

After that, I was visibly upset and the supervisor spoke with me. The decision was then made to move me to a co-ed substance abuse floor (which I don’t have a problem with)- then leaving me to feel like a total freak who is not welcome among women.

I requested to discharge AMA around 10pm and they “lost” that request by morning. I woke up to find out that I’d supposedly rescinded it, which requires a signature I didn’t give. I had to start over in the morning, and got cleared by two or three doctors who decided that in fact I would be more likely to have a productive therapeutic experience outpatient. Many apologies were expressed, but I don’t think anyone who is not trans really can understand the existential dread of being exposed in such a personal manner.

I wrote a complaint at the request of the social worker who wanted to see to it that change was made- but at that point my whole opportunity to actually heal myself was ruined and I now have a lot more to work through in future therapy.

I am writing this because we deserve better. Trans men and women experience harassment and assault on a regular basis. We deserve to be as safe as any woman or man.

I am already serving as a warning to others within the hospital, but I hope that perhaps others might try to at least see things from our perspective.
